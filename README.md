# EENG426_Final
EENG 426 Final Project

Submission Note:

All final cells are in in the powerrouting directory. The final power route has drc errors due to m2 and m3 spacing problems, which we concluded was due to the welltap cell created by the interact script. Thus, ultimately TritonRoute did not successfully run, but all individual cells work correctly and all mapped cells excluding the welltaps at the border of the powerroute do not produce any drc errors.
